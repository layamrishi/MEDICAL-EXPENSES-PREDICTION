## Project Description

- Required packages are imported. From kaggle dataset is readed. 

- **Univariate analysis** - Created Weight status column for easy visualization. Created age interval column for easy visualization. Visualized counts of categories in variables. Distribution of columns are visualized. Checked outliers by boxplot.

- **Bivariate Analysis** - Created expence range column for easy visualization. Relationship between two features are visualized by countplot.

- **Multivariate Analysis** - Visualized corr by heatmap. 

- **Feature Engineering** - 'age_', 'expence_range', 'weight_status' columns are removed from dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing** - Encoding,splitting data and data normalization is done on data.

- **Machine Learning Models** - LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor model is created and performance are analysed. Best model is picked.

- **Model Improvement** - Transformation is done on expenses column and model created with transformation feature. Cross validation score is calculated.
